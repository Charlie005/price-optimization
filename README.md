A small project to find the optimal price of different retail products using multilinear regression.

About the different files:

1. Price_Optimization.py is the python script that contains the code for the process.
2. coefs.csv is the csv file containing the different coefficients and relevant values obtained from training the data
3. Procfile is the instruction file for Heroku
4. priceOptimize.csv is the data file containing whole transaction data
5. requirements.txt contains all packages required for the running of the code

P.S : The training part of the model where the coefs.csv file is created is left commented considering the time taken for execution while deploying on Heroku
